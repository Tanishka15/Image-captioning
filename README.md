# Image Captioning

This project demonstrates an implementation of an **Image Captioning System** using deep learning techniques. The goal is to generate descriptive captions for images by combining computer vision and natural language processing techniques.

## Features
- Preprocessing of images and text data.
- Model architecture combining Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs).
- Training pipeline for generating captions.
- Evaluation and visualization of results.

## Notebook Overview
The notebook `ImageCaptioning.ipynb` contains the following sections:

1. **Introduction**:
   - Overview of the image captioning task: Image captioning is automatically generating textual descriptions for images. It has numerous applications, including enhancing accessibility for visually impaired individuals, organizing and searching photo collections, and assisting in content creation for social media and marketing.
   - The methodology combines a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) as an encoder to extract visual features from images and a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), typically an LSTM, as a decoder to generate captions. The encoder-decoder framework ensures that the extracted image features are translated into coherent and contextually accurate textual descriptions.

2. **Dataset Loading and Preprocessing**:
   -  download and prepare the dataset from Kaggle ( Flickr8k ).
   - Images are resized and normalized before feature extraction using a pre-trained CNN (e.g., InceptionV3 or ResNet).
   - Captions are tokenized, converted to sequences, and padded to ensure uniform length.

3. **Model Architecture**:
   - The encoder is a pre-trained CNN that extracts image features.
   - The decoder is an RNN (LSTM/GRU) that generates textual descriptions based on the extracted features.
   - A dense layer is used to map RNN outputs to vocabulary probabilities.

4. **Training**:
   - The model is trained using the categorical cross-entropy loss function.
   - The Adam optimizer is used to adjust model parameters.
   - Techniques like dropout are applied to prevent overfitting and early stopping is used to halt training when validation performance stops improving.

5. **Evaluation**:
   - BLEU scores (Bilingual Evaluation Understudy) are used to evaluate the quality of generated captions by comparing them with reference captions.
   - Visual examples of test images along with their generated captions are provided.

6. **Conclusion and Future Work**:
   - **Summary of Results**: The model successfully generates semantically meaningful and contextually relevant captions. For example, an image of a dog playing in the park might generate captions like "A dog running in a grassy field" or "A dog playing outdoors." BLEU scores indicate competitive performance when compared to baseline models.
   - **Future Improvements**: Potential enhancements include using transformer-based architectures like Vision Transformers or GPT models for better performance, integrating larger and more diverse datasets to improve generalization, and deploying the model as an interactive web application or API.

## Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- Libraries:
  - TensorFlow/Keras
  - NumPy
  - Matplotlib
  - OpenCV
  - NLTK or SpaCy (for text preprocessing)

You can install the required libraries using:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Dataset
- Supported datasets:[Flickr8k](https://github.com/jbrownlee/Datasets/releases/tag/Flickr8k)
- Ensure the dataset is downloaded and placed in the appropriate directory.

## How to Run
1. Clone this repository.
   ```bash
   git clone <(https://github.com/Tanishka15/Image-captioning)>
   ```
2. Install the required dependencies.
3. Download and preprocess the dataset.
4. Open the `ImageCaptioning.ipynb` notebook and execute the cells step-by-step.

## Results
- Generated captions demonstrate the model's ability to describe images accurately, such as "A cat sitting on a sofa" or "A group of people hiking in the mountains."
- BLEU scores indicate how well the generated captions align with ground truth captions, with higher scores reflecting better performance.

## Future Work
- Improve the model's accuracy by experimenting with transformer-based architectures (e.g., Vision Transformers or GPT models).
- Enhance the dataset by using diverse and larger datasets.
- Deploy the model as a web application or API to make it accessible for real-world use cases.
